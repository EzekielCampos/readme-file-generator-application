## Description

This project is an application that can help a user dynamically generate a README file by just answering a few prompts in the command line.  The goal behind this challenge is to begin using node and incorporate npms in our projects to simplify and shorten our code.  This application makes it simple to create a README file by automatically generating and customizing it with the content the user wants to add.   This in return saves the amount of time that a user has to focus on writing a README from scratch.  During the coding process I learned how powerful and useful npms are.  I like how they’re are so many modules that can be used for certain situations , it helped me keep my code clear and concise.

## Installation

In order to use this application the user must have node installed in their local environment.  If you do not have node installed then go to node website for directions to install. Once node has been installed, go to the directory that holds this application and install the inquirer package to run the CLI prompts.  To do this run the command “npm i inquirer” to install this package.

## Usage

User can automatically generate a README file by answering a few prompts in the command line.  In order to do this go to the directory that holds the application.  Once there, open the terminal and type the command “node index.js” and press enter.  Upon doing that  answer the questions that are prompted, and once done the file will be created and placed into that directory
